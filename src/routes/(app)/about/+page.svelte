        <h2>Initial Commit: Laying the Foundation</h2>
        <p>
          I am a software engineer with a background in
          <strong>software testing</strong> and a deep interest in
          <strong>backend</strong> development. While I primarily focus on
          backend roles, I am also open to <strong>full-stack</strong>
          positions. Additionally, I am eager to deepen my
          <strong>DevOps</strong> skills and gain more experience at a junior level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, my focus is on mastering technical skills and deepening my
          expertise. However, in the future, I am interested in transitioning
          into <strong>leadership</strong> roles, where I can leverage both my
          technical knowledge and <strong>mentoring</strong> experience.

        <h2>My Code Compiles, Therefore I Am</h2>
        <p>
          I approach software development with a strong emphasis on <strong
            >quality</strong
          >, <strong>pragmatism</strong>, and <strong>craftsmanship</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          While <strong>TypeScript</strong> is my primary programming language,
          I take a <strong>technology-agnostic</strong> approach, always striving
          to select the right tools for delivering optimal solutions. My understanding
          of computer science fundamentals allows me to quickly and efficiently learn
          new languages and technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I enjoy <strong>crocheting</strong>â€”an activity that
          mirrors my approach to development: thoughtful, precise, and
          rewarding. It also helps me maintain a
          <strong>healthy balance</strong> between work and life.

        <h2>Version Control: My Next Career Update</h2>
        <p>
          Looking ahead, I am increasingly drawn to <strong>AI</strong>,
          <strong>data science</strong>, and <strong>blockchain</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          While my academic background is not in STEM, my commitment to
          <strong>continuous learning</strong>, driven by a
          <strong>growth mindset</strong>, and a solid foundation in computer
          science drive me to explore these fields. My
          <strong>diverse experiences</strong>, from instructional design to
          sound engineering, have given me a unique perspective and the ability
          to approach complex challenges <strong>creatively</strong> and
          <strong>pragmatically</strong>.

        <h2>Soft Skills Daemon: Running in the Background</h2>
        <p>
          Effective software development goes beyond technical expertise, and
          soft skills play a significant role in my approach to work.
