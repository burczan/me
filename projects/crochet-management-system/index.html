<h1>Scalability Considerations</h1>
<p>The system is designed to support future growth while maintaining high performance for both read-heavy and write-heavy operations. Initially, the architecture will handle a small to moderate number of users, but it must scale effectively as the user base and data volume grow. Below are the strategies for scaling various system components using AWS infrastructure to handle the increasing read and write loads.</p>
<h2>Horizontal and Vertical Scaling</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vertical Scaling</strong>: In the initial stages, the system will use Amazon EC2 instances for the web application and API layers. To handle early load increases, vertical scaling (adding CPU and memory to the instances) will be implemented. This approach works well for early growth and simplifies setup.</li>
<li><strong>Horizontal Scaling</strong>: As the user base grows, horizontal scaling will be achieved through AWS Auto Scaling. This will automatically add or remove EC2 instances based on CPU, memory, or traffic metrics. Horizontal scaling will ensure that the system can distribute both read and write operations efficiently across multiple instances.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Database Scalability</h2>
<p>The system’s database (PostgreSQL) will need to support both read-heavy and write-heavy workloads, especially as users frequently update project details and retrieve large datasets like yarn or pattern information.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Setup</strong>: Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL will be used as the database backend. In the early stages, the database will run on a single node with optimizations for both reads and writes, including proper indexing on searchable fields (yarn attributes, project status, etc.) and query optimization for cost-related calculations.</li>
<li><strong>Future Scalability</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Read Replicas</strong>: To handle increasing read-heavy operations (e.g., users frequently searching and filtering yarns or viewing project details), read replicas will be deployed. RDS Read Replicas will offload read operations from the primary database, improving performance for users fetching data.</li>
<li><strong>Write-Optimized Instances</strong>: For write-heavy workloads (e.g., adding new yarns, updating projects, and syncing offline changes), the database will be optimized for faster write operations by using scalable storage options that support high I/O throughput. The system will prioritize configurations that allow for rapid data writes, such as increasing instance sizes, using storage types optimized for frequent read/write operations, and adjusting I/O capacity to meet growing demands.</li>
<li><strong>Sharding</strong>: If the database reaches a point where vertical scaling is insufficient, sharding will be introduced. Data can be partitioned, for example, by user ID or project category to distribute both read and write loads across multiple database nodes.</li>
<li><strong>Caching</strong>: For frequently accessed, read-heavy data like yarn attributes and pattern files, a distributed cache using Amazon ElastiCache (Redis) will be introduced. This will store commonly requested data in memory to reduce database load and improve response times.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Web Application Scalability</h2>
<p>The Web Application serves as the user interface, allowing users to manage yarn inventory, projects, and patterns. As the number of users increases, the Web Application must be able to handle more concurrent connections and traffic, ensuring responsiveness and availability.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Setup</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Horizontal Scaling</strong>: The Web Application will be deployed on AWS EC2 instances behind an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). As the user base grows, additional EC2 instances can be automatically added or removed based on traffic patterns using AWS Auto Scaling. This ensures that the application can handle increased traffic without sacrificing performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Future Scalability</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>CDN for Static Assets</strong>: Static assets (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) will be distributed using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) like AWS CloudFront. This ensures faster delivery of assets by caching them closer to users, reducing latency and improving load times, especially for geographically dispersed users.</li>
<li><strong>Serverless Options</strong>: For further scaling and reducing maintenance overhead, parts of the web application could be migrated to serverless platforms like AWS Amplify or AWS Lambda. This would allow the system to scale automatically without needing to manage underlying server infrastructure, particularly for handling spikes in user activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>API Layer Scalability</h2>
<p>The API layer, built with Node.js and Express, must handle both read-heavy and write-heavy traffic as users interact with the system, especially when fetching patterns, updating projects, and performing financial calculations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Setup</strong>: The API will run on Amazon EC2 instances, and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) will be used to distribute incoming API requests across multiple instances, ensuring that both read and write operations are handled efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>Future Scalability</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Load Balancing for Read/Write Separation</strong>: In the future, separate load balancers and EC2 instance groups can be used to optimize for read-heavy and write-heavy traffic. API requests for fetching yarns and patterns (read-heavy) can be routed to instances optimized for reads, while updates to projects and patterns (write-heavy) can be directed to instances optimized for writes.</li>
<li><strong>Microservices for Scalability</strong>: As the system evolves, the monolithic API can be refactored into microservices using AWS Lambda for serverless execution or containerized with Amazon ECS. Each service (e.g., yarn management, project management) can be scaled independently based on specific workload patterns (e.g., project management might be more write-heavy, while pattern viewing is more read-heavy).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>File Storage Scalability</h2>
<p>The system stores unstructured data, like crochet pattern files, in AWS S3, which is well-suited for scaling file storage as user uploads grow. S3 can easily handle both read-heavy and write-heavy operations. With its virtually unlimited storage capacity, S3 can scale seamlessly with the system’s growth.</p>
<h2>Monitoring and Auto-scaling</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong>: Monitoring will be performed using Amazon CloudWatch, which will track key metrics (e.g., database read/write performance, API request times, cache hit/miss rates). Alerts will be set up to notify the team if performance bottlenecks arise, allowing for proactive scaling or adjustments.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-scaling</strong>: The system will use AWS Auto Scaling to dynamically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on real-time metrics such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and traffic patterns. This allows the system to scale automatically during periods of high read or write traffic, maintaining performance and availability.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Performance and Optimizations</h1>
<p>The system is designed to maintain high performance as it scales, ensuring efficient data retrieval, smooth user interactions, and fast syncing of data. Below are the key performance strategies and optimization.</p>
<h2>Database Optimization</h2>
<h3>Indexing</h3>
<p>Indexing will be applied to frequently queried fields such as yarn attributes (e.g., weight, fiber content) and project statuses. By creating indexes on these fields, the system can quickly locate relevant data without scanning the entire table, significantly speeding up search and filtering operations, especially as the dataset grows. Indexing is particularly crucial for ensuring that queries return results efficiently, even with large inventories or projects.</p>
<p>In addition to speeding up common queries, indexes will be carefully managed to balance read and write performance. While indexing enhances read operations, it can slightly slow down write operations (e.g., adding new yarn entries), so only the most frequently queried fields will be indexed to maintain overall performance.</p>
<h3>Query Optimization</h3>
<p>Complex queries, such as calculating total yarn costs for projects, will be optimized to avoid performance bottlenecks like full table scans. Techniques like query caching will be implemented to store the results of frequently executed queries, reducing the need to recompute them.</p>
<h2>Caching for Faster Data Retrieval</h2>
<h3>Server-Side Data Caching</h3>
<p>Server-side caching is used to store frequently accessed data, such as yarn inventory and project details, in memory to improve retrieval speeds and reduce the load on the database. This is especially beneficial for read-heavy operations like searching yarns or viewing projects, as it significantly reduces latency and improves overall system performance.</p>
<h3>Client-Side Caching</h3>
<p>Client-side caching is handled by service workers, which cache static resources such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the user’s browser. This enables faster page loads, as these assets are retrieved from the local cache rather than re-fetched from the server on every visit. Additionally, this supports offline functionality, allowing users to interact with cached data and static assets even when they are not connected to the internet.</p>
<h2>Efficient Data Syncing</h2>
<p>To optimize the synchronization process when users reconnect after working offline, the system employs incremental syncing and batching sync operations, which work in tandem to reduce sync time and server load.</p>
<p>Incremental syncing identifies changes made offline and syncs only those differences with the server, minimizing data transfer and speeding up the sync process.</p>
<p>Batching then groups these changes into a smaller number of API requests, lowering latency and reducing the number of calls made to the server. For example, related changes like yarn updates or project modifications are combined into a single request, rather than sending each change separately.</p>
<p>Together, these techniques ensure that only necessary data is synced and that it is sent efficiently, providing a faster, smoother user experience.</p>
<h1>Security Considerations</h1>
<p>Although the system doesn’t handle sensitive financial or personal data, basic security measures are in place to protect user data and ensure the system operates reliably.</p>
<h2>Authentication and Authorization</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>JWT for Authentication</strong>: The system will use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate users. This ensures that only authorized users can access and modify their own data (e.g., yarn inventory, projects).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Data Encryption</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Encryption at Rest</strong>: Although the data is not highly sensitive, all user data (e.g., yarn information, project details) stored in the database and file storage will be encrypted at rest using standard encryption methods. This ensures that even if unauthorized access to the storage occurs, the data remains protected.</li>
<li><strong>Encryption in Transit</strong>: All communication between the client and the server will be secured using TLS (Transport Layer Security), ensuring that data exchanged over the network is protected from eavesdropping or tampering.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Input Validation</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Server-Side Validation</strong>: User input will be validated on both the client and server side to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Basic Rate Limiting</h2>
<p>Rate limiting sets a cap on the number of API requests a client (user, device, or IP) can make over a specific period (e.g., 100 requests per minute). If a client exceeds this limit, further requests are either blocked or delayed until the rate limit resets.</p>
<p>To prevent abuse, the system will implement basic rate limiting on API endpoints, ensuring that no single user can overwhelm the system with excessive requests.</p>
<h1>High-Level Architecture</h1>
<p>The architecture of the Crochet Management System is described using the <a href="https://c4model.com/">C4 model</a>. This model provides a clear and structured way to visualize the system at multiple levels:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>System Context</strong>: Shows how the user interacts with the Crochet Management System through the Web Application.</li>
<li><strong>Container</strong>: Breaks down the system into containers, including the Web Application, API Layer, Database, and File Storage.</li>
<li><strong>Component</strong>: Provides a detailed look at the components within the API Layer, such as the Yarn API, Pattern API, Project API, and Calculator API, and how they interact with the Database and File Storage.</li>
</ol>
<p>This layered approach to the architecture ensures that each component has a clear responsibility, promoting modularity, scalability, and maintainability.</p>
<h2>C4 Model Level 1: System Context View</h2>
<p>The User interacts with the Crochet Management System through a Web Application running in the browser to manage yarns, patterns, and projects.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/me/_app/immutable/assets/crochetMS_system_context.DtlamE4W.svg"></p>
<h2>C4 Model Level 2: Container View</h2>
<p>The Container View breaks down the system into its major components and describes how they communicate. In this system, we have the following containers:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/me/_app/immutable/assets/crochetMS_container_crochet_management_system.BKvRjGry.svg"></p>
<h3>Web Application (Browser)</h3>
<p>The client-side application through which the user interacts with the system. It provides the interface for users to manage yarns, patterns, and projects. The Web Application uses Local Storage to cache unsynced changes (e.g., new yarns or project updates) when the user is offline.</p>
<h3>API Layer</h3>
<p>The API layer serves as the intermediary between the web application and the backend services. The Web Application sends requests to the API Layer, which handles business logic and interacts with the Database and File Storage for data storage and retrieval.</p>
<h3>Database (Relational Database)</h3>
<p>A relational database that stores yarn, pattern, and project data in dedicated tables. It supports complex queries and operations via the API layer and is optimized for performance with indexing and query optimization techniques.</p>
<h3>File Storage (Cloud Storage)</h3>
<p>Unstructured data such as pattern charts and project images are stored in cloud storage, providing scalability and reliable access for large files.</p>
<h3>Local Storage (Client-Side Storage)</h3>
<p>Temporarily stores unsynced data while the user is offline. When the user reconnects, this data is synced with the backend to ensure consistency across all devices.</p>
<h2>C4 Model Level 3: Component View</h2>
<h3>API Layer</h3>
<p>The API layer handles all business logic and serves as the intermediary between the web application and the backend services. It is composed of multiple components that handle various aspects of the system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yarn API</strong>: Handles CRUD operations for managing yarn data.</li>
<li><strong>Pattern API</strong>: Manages pattern data and interacts with cloud storage for storing and retrieving pattern charts.</li>
<li><strong>Project API</strong>: Manages project data, including progress tracking and project images stored in the cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Calculator API</strong>: Performs cost calculations based on yarn usage and project progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>The API Layer communicates with both the database and file storage containers to retrieve or update data as necessary. This division of responsibilities ensures modularity and maintainability.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/me/_app/immutable/assets/crochetMS_component_api_layer.D9xFDxDP.svg"></p>
<h3>Database</h3>

<p>Choosing React as the Frontend Framework for an Offline-First Web Application</p>
<h3>Status</h3>
<p>Accepted</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>The system is designed for crochet enthusiasts to manage yarn inventory, track projects, store crochet patterns, and monitor associated costs. The application must support offline functionality, allowing users to view, modify, and sync their data when they regain an internet connection. It must also be user-friendly for non-technical users, handle a moderate amount of data without performance degradation, and be easy to extend and maintain over time. Additionally, we need a solution that supports reusable components.</p>
<h3>Decision Drivers</h3>
<p>The following key drivers influenced the decision:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Offline Support</strong>: The frontend must support Progressive Web Application (PWA) capabilities, including service workers for caching and background sync, to ensure smooth offline functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Component Reusability</strong>: A component-based architecture is essential to simplify UI development and ensure scalability, allowing for the reuse of components like yarn cards, project forms, and pattern uploads.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: The system should handle a moderate number of yarns and projects (hundreds of entries) without noticeable performance degradation.</li>
<li><strong>State Management</strong>: Efficient state management is required to manage unsynced changes made while offline, ensuring smooth transitions between offline and online states.</li>
<li><strong>Ecosystem</strong>: The library should have a robust ecosystem, including tools for routing, form handling, state management, and offline support.</li>
<li><strong>Team Expertise</strong>: The development team has prior experience with React, reducing the learning curve and minimizing the risks of adopting a new technology.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Alternative Options Considered</h3>

<p>The system is an offline-first web application designed for managing crochet projects, yarn inventory, and crochet patterns. Users will need to be able to work seamlessly while offline and have their data synchronized when they reconnect to the internet. The backend must provide a scalable API to handle requests for yarn, project, and pattern data, support file uploads (e.g., crochet pattern PDFs and images), and manage business logic, such as calculating project costs.</p>
<p>Additionally, the backend must integrate with cloud services (e.g., AWS S3 for file storage) and handle asynchronous tasks, such as syncing offline data when the user reconnects. Given the team’s expertise in JavaScript, a solution that minimizes the learning curve and development time while offering high performance for handling I/O-bound operations is crucial. The ability to scale the system in the future is also important, as the application may grow in terms of user base and data volume.</p>
<h3>Decision Drivers</h3>
<p>The following key drivers influenced our decision-making process for the backend:</p>

<li><strong>Authentication</strong>: The backend must support lightweight, stateless user authentication, likely using JWT for securing user access to their inventory and projects.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Alternative Options Considered</h3>
<p>Those options were rejected:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Python with Flask</strong>: Flask was considered because of its simplicity and flexibility for building small, RESTful APIs. However, it is synchronous by default, requiring additional configuration to handle concurrent requests efficiently, which would increase complexity. For this reason, Node.js with its non-blocking I/O architecture was preferred for better handling of multiple concurrent requests.</li>
<li><strong>Python with Django</strong>: While Django is a powerful full-stack framework with built-in features like an ORM and user management, it was rejected due to its added complexity and heavier architecture, which is unnecessary for this project. The project only requires a lightweight backend for RESTful APIs, making Express a better fit.</li>
<li><strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>: Rails was considered for its productivity features and built-in functionality, but it was rejected due to concerns about its performance for handling I/O-bound tasks and the team’s unfamiliarity with Ruby. Using Rails would introduce a steep learning curve and increase development time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Decision</h3>
<p>We decided to use Node.js with Express as the backend framework for building the RESTful API and handling the I/O-bound operations of the offline-first web application.</p>
<h3>Rationale</h3>
<p>Node.js with Express was chosen because it meets the project’s key requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance and Scalability</strong>: Node.js is well-suited for handling I/O-bound tasks, such as serving API requests and managing data synchronization, which are key needs for this system. Its event-driven, non-blocking architecture ensures that the backend can handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>Developer Efficiency and Familiarity</strong>: The development team is already proficient in JavaScript and Node.js, reducing the risk of delays or errors in the development process. This familiarity allows the team to focus on building core features quickly and efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>RESTful API Support</strong>: Express is a lightweight and flexible framework that allows for fast and straightforward creation of RESTful APIs. This makes it ideal for managing CRUD operations for yarns, projects, and patterns.</li>

<li><strong>Maintainability</strong>: Express’s minimalist design provides flexibility and simplicity, ensuring that the backend is modular and easy to maintain. This supports future scalability and adaptability as the project grows.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong>: Node.js works seamlessly with JWT for stateless authentication, providing secure access to user-specific data while keeping the authentication system lightweight.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consequences</h3>
<h4>Positive</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Efficient I/O Handling</strong>: Node.js’s non-blocking, asynchronous nature ensures the backend can efficiently handle I/O-bound tasks such as data synchronization, database queries, and file uploads, which are core operations in this project.</li>
<li><strong>Developer Productivity</strong>: The team’s familiarity with JavaScript and Node.js reduces onboarding time and allows for faster development, decreasing the overall development risk and ensuring that the team can focus on delivering functionality rather than learning new technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Simple API Development</strong>: Express simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs, making it easy to implement CRUD operations for yarns, projects, and patterns, while keeping the codebase maintainable and scalable.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Integration</strong>: Node.js integrates seamlessly with AWS S3 for file storage and PostgreSQL for database management, ensuring that we can scale the storage and database requirements of the system as the user base grows.</li>

This also ensures that future requirements, such as new API endpoints or business logic, can be added with minimal refactoring.</li>
<li><strong>Stateless Authentication</strong>: Using JWT for authentication ensures lightweight, secure, and scalable access control for users, fitting well with the stateless nature of Node.js and enabling easy scaling.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Negative</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single-threaded Limitations</strong>: While Node.js handles I/O-bound tasks well, it may struggle with CPU-intensive tasks due to its single-threaded nature. However, this is mitigated because the system’s primary operations are I/O-bound (e.g., API requests, file handling), so performance bottlenecks are unlikely.</li>
<li><strong>Middleware Complexity</strong>: While Express is lightweight and flexible, it requires additional middleware to handle common backend tasks such as authentication (e.g., JWT), file uploads (e.g., Multer), and error handling. This can introduce complexity, but the wide availability of libraries in the Node.js ecosystem mitigates this challenge.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Subsequent ADRs</h4>
<ul>
<li>A future ADR will be needed to choose the database schema and define the relationships between yarns, projects, and patterns.</li>
<li>Another ADR may be required to choose a deployment strategy (e.g., containers, serverless) for the Node.js backend.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Status</h3>
<p>Accepted</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>The system will manage data for yarn inventory, crochet projects, and patterns, all of which require structured data storage. Users will need to filter, search, and organize their data based on various attributes (e.g., yarn weight, fiber content, project status). The database must be able to handle structured relationships between these entities and support complex queries such as joins and filtering by multiple criteria. In addition, the system must be scalable to support future growth, with efficient querying and data integrity.</p>
<p>The database will be accessed via a RESTful API, and its performance must remain consistent as the user base and data volume grow. The database should also integrate seamlessly with cloud services for backup, recovery, and scalability.</p>
<h3>Decision Drivers</h3>
<p>The following key drivers influenced the decision-making process for the database:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Relational Data Model</strong>: The system needs a robust relational model to manage relationships between yarn, projects, and patterns, allowing for complex queries and data integrity through features like foreign keys and constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Structured Query Support</strong>: The database must support complex queries, such as filtering yarns by attributes and calculating project costs, while ensuring efficient performance even as the dataset grows.</li>

Since our system requires scalability and the ability to handle multiple users simultaneously, PostgreSQL’s client-server architecture is a better fit.</li>
<li><strong>NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB)</strong>: Rejected because the project requires complex relationships between entities, which are best modeled using a relational database. NoSQL databases are more suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data and do not natively support the complex querying and relationship constraints that PostgreSQL provides.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Decision</h3>
<p>We decided to use PostgreSQL as the database for the offline-first web application. PostgreSQL’s robust relational model, support for complex queries, scalability, and full-text search capabilities make it the best choice for the system’s data management needs.</p>

<li><strong>Performance</strong>: S3 provides fast, reliable access to files, with options like S3 Transfer Acceleration to further enhance performance for users uploading large files from remote locations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consequences</h3>
<h4>Positive</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scalability without Maintenance</strong>: AWS S3 scales automatically as more pattern files are uploaded, requiring no intervention or maintenance. This frees up the development team from needing to manage or adjust storage capacity as the system grows.</li>
<li><strong>Pay-as-you-go Model</strong>: The cost structure of AWS S3 ensures that we only pay for the storage we use, which is cost-efficient at the beginning and will remain flexible as the storage needs increase.</li>
<li><strong>Built-in Redundancy and Backup</strong>: AWS S3 ensures that data is replicated across multiple locations, providing durability and protection against data loss. This reduces the need for the team to implement their own backup solution.</li>
<li><strong>Simple Integration with Backend</strong>: The AWS SDK makes it easy to handle file uploads and retrievals through the existing Node.js backend, simplifying the development effort.</li>
</ul>

<h2>ADR #5: Choosing Workbox for Offline Support</h2>
<h3>Title</h3>
<p>Choosing Workbox for Offline Support</p>
<h3>Status</h3>
<p>Accepted</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>The web application requires offline functionality so that users can manage yarn inventory, projects, and crochet patterns without an internet connection. Users need to view and edit their data while offline, and these changes should automatically sync with the server once the user reconnects.</p>
<p>The offline functionality must allow for:</p>

<h2>ADR #6: Choosing Last Write Wins (LWW) for Conflict Resolution</h2>
<h3>Title</h3>
<p>Choosing Last Write Wins (LWW) for Conflict Resolution with Optional User-Assisted Resolution</p>
<h3>Status</h3>
<p>Accepted</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>The application allows users to work offline and make changes to their data, such as yarn inventory or crochet projects. When the user reconnects to the internet, these offline changes need to be synced with the server. However, conflicts may arise if the user on another device has updated the same data while offline.</p>
<p>The system must automatically resolve such conflicts when syncing, but the solution should be simple to implement and maintain while ensuring consistency. However, in some cases, users may wish to have more control over how their data conflicts are resolved.</p>
<h3>Decision Drivers</h3>
<p>The following key drivers influenced the decision-making process for conflict resolution:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: The conflict resolution strategy should be easy to implement and maintain without introducing unnecessary complexity.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: The system must ensure that conflicting changes are resolved in a consistent and predictable manner.</li>
<li><strong>Automated Resolution</strong>: For most cases, conflicts should be resolved automatically by the system to avoid overwhelming users with manual conflict resolution tasks.</li>
<li><strong>User Control</strong>: In critical scenarios, users may prefer to have control over which version of their data is kept, especially for important project details.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Alternative Options Considered</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manual Conflict Resolution</strong>: This option would involve asking users to manually resolve conflicts by choosing between conflicting versions of data. This was rejected because it introduces unnecessary complexity for users and could slow down workflows. However, this approach could be selectively applied for critical data, offering more flexibility.</li>
<li><strong>Versioning</strong>: This strategy creates a version history for each change, allowing the system or the user to resolve conflicts by comparing different versions of the data. While this offers granular control and safety, it was rejected for this phase due to its complexity and the overhead it introduces in terms of storage and version management.</li>
<li><strong>Merging Changes</strong>: This option attempts to combine changes from different versions, requiring sophisticated logic to identify conflicts and merge data. While powerful, this was rejected due to the added complexity and potential for unexpected behavior in a system where conflicts are relatively rare and simple.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Decision</h3>
<p>We decided to implement Last Write Wins (LWW) as the primary conflict resolution strategy, combined with optional user-assisted conflict resolution for critical cases. LWW resolves conflicts by overwriting the previous data with the most recent update based on a timestamp. However, for certain sensitive data (e.g., project milestones or financial calculations), the system will allow users to manually resolve conflicts when needed.</p>
<h3>Rationale</h3>
<p>The Last Write Wins (LWW) strategy was chosen because it satisfies the project’s key requirements of simplicity and consistency, while the introduction of optional user-assisted resolution for key scenarios provides a safety net for handling more sensitive data.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: LWW is a straightforward solution that requires minimal development effort. By simply comparing timestamps of conflicting data and accepting the most recent update, implementation remains lightweight and easy to manage.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: LWW ensures that data remains consistent across the system after conflicts are resolved, preventing duplicate or outdated information. Since most data in the system (e.g., yarn inventory) is not highly sensitive, automated resolution fits well.</li>
<li><strong>Automated Resolution</strong>: For most data, users are not required to take action. The system handles conflicts automatically, allowing for a smooth and uninterrupted user experience.</li>
<li><strong>User Control for Critical Data</strong>: For key data elements (e.g., completed project stages, financial records), users will have the option to manually resolve conflicts when reconnecting to the internet. This provides flexibility without complicating the system for less important data.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consequences</h3>
<h4>Positive</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower Risk of User Confusion</strong>: For the majority of data, LWW resolves conflicts automatically, reducing the chance that users will encounter confusing conflict resolution workflows. For critical data, the user-assisted option ensures that data loss is minimized where it matters most.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Development Time</strong>: Implementing LWW requires less development effort than more complex strategies like versioning or merging. This allows the project to focus on core functionalities without getting bogged down by conflict resolution complexities.</li>
<li><strong>Predictable Behavior</strong>: The LWW approach provides consistent and predictable behavior, making it easier for both users and developers to understand how conflicts are resolved. With the option to allow manual resolution for critical data, users retain control where needed.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: The simplicity of LWW makes it easy to scale as the system grows, allowing for conflict resolution to remain efficient even as the number of users and devices increases.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Negative</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Potential Data Loss in LWW</strong>: In scenarios where LWW is applied, older changes may be overwritten without user input. However, by restricting manual conflict resolution to key scenarios, the system mitigates the risk of data loss for important data.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Complexity for User-Assisted Resolution</strong>: Introducing optional manual conflict resolution adds a bit of complexity in terms of development and user experience. However, this complexity is limited to a subset of critical data, balancing user control with system automation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the context of <strong>providing conflict resolution for an offline-first web application</strong>,</li>
<li>facing <strong>the need for simplicity, consistency, automated resolution, and user control in critical scenarios</strong>,</li>
<li>we decided to use <strong>Last Write Wins (LWW)</strong> for the majority of data with <strong>optional user-assisted conflict resolution</strong> for critical data,</li>

<h2>ADR #7: Choosing a Distributed Architecture</h2>
<h3>Title</h3>
<p>Choosing a Distributed Architecture</p>
<h3>Status</h3>
<p>Accepted</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>The system is designed for crochet enthusiasts to manage yarn inventory, track projects, store crochet patterns, and monitor associated costs. The current scope targets a small number of users, but the system must be able to scale as new features are added, third-party integrations are introduced, and the user base grows over time.</p>
<p>To ensure long-term flexibility, scalability, and ease of introducing new components or integrations, the choice of architecture must balance initial simplicity with the ability to evolve and grow over time.</p>
<h3>Decision Drivers</h3>
<p>The following key factors influence the architecture decision:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: The architecture must allow for scaling as the user base grows and as different components of the system (e.g., yarn management, project management) require more resources.</li>
<li><strong>Future Integrations</strong>: The system may need to support third-party services (e.g., yarn price APIs, pattern repositories) and new features in the future. The architecture must accommodate these integrations with minimal disruption.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Efficiency</strong>: The system should remain cost-effective at its current scale while providing a clear path for handling increased operational complexity as it grows.</li>
<li><strong>Maintainability</strong>: The architecture should make it easy to manage, update, and debug individual components of the system.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Alternative Options Considered</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monolithic Architecture</strong>: A monolithic approach bundles all components into a single deployment unit, simplifying early development and deployment. However, it was rejected because it introduces scalability limitations, as the entire application would need to be deployed or scaled as a single unit. This would also make future integrations more complex and require greater refactoring efforts as the system grows.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Decision</h3>
<p>We decided to adopt a distributed architecture, beginning with a modular approach where individual services (e.g., yarn management, project management) are designed as independent components. Initially, these services may be deployed together, but the architecture will allow for gradual decoupling into independent deployment units as the system grows.</p>
<h3>Rationale</h3>
<p>The distributed architecture was chosen because it best supports the system’s long-term goals of scalability, flexibility, and independent service management:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: As the user base grows or new features are introduced, services can be scaled independently without affecting other components.</li>
<li><strong>Future-Proofing</strong>: Distributed architecture supports the integration of third-party services and new features more easily, without needing a complete system overhaul.</li>
<li><strong>Modular Evolution</strong>: Starting with loosely coupled services within a distributed system allows for future migration to a microservices approach, but without the complexity and overhead of full microservices from the start.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consequences</h3>
<h4>Positive</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easier Maintenance Over Time</strong>: The modular structure will make it easier to manage, update, and debug individual components without affecting the entire system. This will reduce the long-term technical debt associated with the system’s evolution.</li>
<li><strong>Faster Time to Market for New Features</strong>: The ability to independently develop, update, and deploy different parts of the system will allow faster iteration and deployment of new features or services without requiring full redeployments of the entire system.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Resource Allocation</strong>: Independent scaling of components means resources can be allocated efficiently based on the actual usage patterns of different parts of the system (e.g., scaling the yarn management service separately from the project tracking service).</li>
<li><strong>Better User Experience</strong>: Updates and changes to specific services can be made with minimal or no downtime, providing a smoother and more reliable user experience.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Negative</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Complexity</strong>: While not as complex as full microservices, distributed architecture introduces some complexity in managing communication between services and ensuring consistency.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Overhead for Small Scale</strong>: In the early stages, with a small user base, the overhead of managing distributed services may add unnecessary complexity compared to a monolithic architecture.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Subsequent ADRs</h3>
<ul>
<li>A future ADR may define the specific strategies for managing communication between distributed services, such as choosing between REST APIs, message queues, or event-driven communication.</li>
</ul>
